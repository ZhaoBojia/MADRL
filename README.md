# MADRL: Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning

This repository contains the core implementation of our **Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL)** algorithm, developed as part of our ongoing research on intelligent wireless communication systems.

Currently, the repository provides:

- `main_3.py`: The main training and evaluation script.
- `env_3.py`: The custom environment used in our experiments.

The complete models and additional code will be released after the acceptance of our related paper to facilitate reproducibility and further research.

## Project Highlights

- Multi-agent reinforcement learning framework
- Custom environment modeling for multi-agent interaction
- Designed for secure and efficient wireless communication scenarios
